{% include JB/setup %}

- `i` -> Insert mode, Type `ESC` to return to Normal mode.
- `x` -> Delete the char under the cursor
- `:wq` -> Save and Quit (`:w` save, `:q` quit)
- `dd` -> Delete (and copy) the current line
- `p` -> Paste

- `hjkl` (highly recommended but not mandatory) -> basic cursor move (←↓↑→)
- `:help <command>` -> Show help about `<command>`. You can use `:help` without a `<command>` to get general help.

1. Insert mode variations:

- `a` -> insert after the cursor
- `o` -> insert a new line after the current one
- `O` -> insert a new line before the current one
- `cw` -> replace from the cursor to the end of the word

2. Basic moves

- `0` -> go to the first column
- `^` -> go to the first non-blank character of the line
- `$` -> go to the end of line
- `g_` -> go to the last non-blank character of line
- `/pattern` -> search of `pattern`

3. Copy/Paste

- `P` -> paste before, remember `p` is patste after current position
- `yy` -> copy the current line, easier but equivalent to `ddP`

4. Undo/Redo

- `u` -> undo
- `<C-r>` -> redo

5. Load/Save/Quit/Change File (Buffer)

- `:e <path/to/file>` -> open
- `:w` -> save
- `:saveas <path/to/file>` -> save to `<path/to/file>`
- `:x`,`ZZ` or `:wq` -> save and quit (`:x` only save if necessary)
-`:q!` -> quit without saving, also: `:qa!` to quit even if there are modified hidden buffers.
-`:bn` (resp `:bp`) -> show next (resp. previous) file (buffer)
