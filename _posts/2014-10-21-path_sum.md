## 题目

[题目链接](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

For example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

          5
         / \
        4   8
       /   / \
      11  13  4
     /  \      \
    7    2      1

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
