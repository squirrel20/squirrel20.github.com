## 题目

[题目链接](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,

"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.

"race a car" is not a palindrome.

Note:

Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

## 分析

想不另外再写函数，只在一个函数里面写出简单的代码好麻烦。
